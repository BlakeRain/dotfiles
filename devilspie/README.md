# Devilspie Configuration

https://www.nongnu.org/devilspie2/

Devilspie is a window matching utility which allows us to override various window settings in X. This directory contains
the configuration files that I use on Linux to undecorate various terminal emulators. This is used to remove the window
decorations from terminal windows.
